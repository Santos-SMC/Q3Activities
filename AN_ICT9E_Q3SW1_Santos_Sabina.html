	<h1 class="bg-warning text-danger text-center">Seven Deadly Sins</h1>
	<p>The Seven Deadly Sins, Nanatsu no Taizai, are the Kingdom of Liones' most powerful and cruel order of Holy Knights. They were created by seven brutal criminals who had all been convicted of heinous crimes and had carved the symbols of seven beasts onto their bodies. The Seven Deadly Sins were formed for the express purpose of defeating the Demon Clan's Ten Commandments, unbeknownst to most of its members.</p>

			<h2 class="bg-danger text-warning">Meliodas</h2>
			<p>Meliodas' power level ranges from 60,000 to 142,000, and his magical power is Full Counter; Hellblaze. On his left arm, near the shoulder, he has a circle with the symbol of a dragon biting its own tail. Meliodas considers his sin to be his failure to save Danafor, its citizens, and Liz from the annihilation of the kingdom. According to legend, Meliodas became enraged and annihilated the Kingdom himself.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="col-9">
			<h2 class="bg-danger text-warning">Merlin</h2>
			<p>Merlin has a power level of 4,710 and magical power of Infinity. On the left side of her neck, she has a boar face mark with twigs growing in it. Merlin considers her "innermost sin" to be plotting Chaos's liberation, even if it meant manipulating the Deadly Sins and thus filling the hole left in her heart by Meliodas, who had not returned her feelings of love. Merlin is the only one of the Seven Deadly Sins who willingly committed the crime for which she is being held accountable.</p>

			<h2 class="bg-danger text-warning">King</h2>
			<p>King has a power level of 41,610 and the magical power Disaster. He has the grizzly bear's mark above his left foot, which is usually hidden beneath his pants and shoes. After presumably ending Helbram's life, King accepted the sentence for ignoring Helbram's continuous mass murder of humans over a five-hundred-year period. This came dangerously close to igniting a war between humans and fairies. As a result, he was sentenced to a thousand years in prison and was known as the Sin of Sloth because he ignored the atrocities committed and turned a blind eye. In reality, King was suffering from amnesia at the time.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="col-9">
			<h2 class="bg-danger text-warning">Diane</h2>
			<p>Diane has a power level of 8,800 and the magical ability Creation. She has a snake mark on her left thigh, with one end of its tail rolled up. Diane and her mentor, Matrona, were hired as mercenaries by Liones knights to aid them in a battle against foreign savages. The Holy Knight Gannon deceives them, revealing his true intentions of destroying a giant for the sake of reputation and prestige. She is eventually labeled the Sin of Envy for her jealousy of Matrona (who she allegedly murdered) and 330 innocent knights of the kingdom. She is sentenced to death by beheading, but Meliodas intervenes on the king of Liones' direct orders.</p>

			<h2 class="bg-danger text-warning">Ban</h2>
			<p>Ban has a power level of 3,220 and the magical power Snatch. He has a fox symbol on the left side of his waist. As the sole survivor of the Fairy King's Forest, he accepted responsibility and was convicted of destroying the forest and murdering its guardian saint, Elaine, in order to gain immortality from the Fountain of Youth. As a result of his apparent greed for immortality, he was sentenced to death and became known as the Sin of Greed. In reality, a Red Demon attacked the forest, which he stopped. Ban and Elaine were both injured, and Elaine chose to save his life by giving him fountain water.</p>

		<div class="col-9">
			<h2 class="bg-danger text-warning">Gowther</h2>
			<p>Gowther has a power level of 35,400 and the magical power Invasion. On the right side of his chest, he has a goat with massive horns. Gowther was granted the Sin of Lust after being accused of forcing Nadja, Bartra Liones' elder sister, to commit heinous sexual acts that led to his murder of her. In reality, Nadja and Gowther were in love and content in each other's company. It was later revealed that Nadja was dying and wished to spend her final moments with Gowther. She died peacefully within his embrace after a passionate moment, and in a panic, he attempted to reanimate her by ripping out his magical heart and replacing it with Nadja's, but it failed.</p>

			<h2 class="bg-danger text-warning">Escanor</h2>
			<p>Escanor has a power level of 15-114,000 and the magical power Sunshine. He bears the lion's mark, with a scar on its right eye covering his back. The Kingdom of Liones accuses Escanor of terrorizing and destroying many villages and towns, injuring the Holy Knights who tried to restrain him, including the Great Holy Knight Zaratras, and disrespecting the king. He is labeled the Sin of Pride and sentenced to flogging followed by public hanging. Escanor is the only one of the Seven Deadly Sins who is actually responsible for the crime for which he is wrongfully accused. Sunshine's power causes him to be extremely arrogant during the day.</p>
