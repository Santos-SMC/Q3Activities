	<p>A fire can occur anywhere, and it is critical to always prepare for what you would do if one happened in your home. Similarly, it is necessary to consider all of the ways you can prevent one from occurring in the first place.<br><br>You want to know how to prevent fire in your home to protect it and the people you love. There are simple steps you may take to keep yourself safer, and if you start right now, you may be able to prevent a problem from occurring.</p>

		<div class="col-9">
			<h2 class="text-warning">Unplug Unused Items</h2>
			<p>Excess electricity flowing through your home's items is always a potential fire hazard. Computers, televisions, game systems, and other electronic devices use electricity even when off. That means they can always experience a surge or overheat and catch fire. You can reduce your chances of fire by unplugging these items when you're not using them and thus not paying attention to them.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="col-9">
			<h2 class="text-warning">Use Surge Protectors</h2>
			<p>When there is a surge in power, you are more likely to have an electrical fire. When you plug cords into a surge protector, you do not have to worry about excess electricity getting to the object and causing a fire. The surge protector keeps that extra out and can significantly reduce your chances of having a fire in the first place, as well as the severity of it if you do have one. Note that a surge protector differs from an extension cord. </p>

		<div class="col-9">
			<h2 class="text-warning">Never Leave Flames Unattended</h2>
			<p>Keep an eye on anything involving a flame or a lot of heat, whether you are cooking, lighting candles, or doing anything similar. In monitoring these flammables, you see any issues or deviations from the norm immediately, implying that you would be able to address the problem swiftly and ensure your and your family's safety. Smoke alarms and a fire extinguisher are also practical in this location.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="col-9">
			<h2 class="text-warning">Store Flammables in a Safe Location</h2>
			<p>Kerosene, paint, thinner, bleach, alcohol, and other flammable materials should always be kept out of children's reach, as should matches, lighters, and igniters. You don't want them to be mistaken for toys by your children. Also, they should be stored in a dry, secure location at a cool room temperature to prevent the possibility of a fire.</p>

		<div class="col-9">
			<h2 class="text-warning">Don't Smoke Inside the House</h2>
			<p>If you smoke, it's crucial to do so in a place with good ventilation and to extinguish the cigarette before discarding it. Cigarettes include several chemicals and ingredients that might cause them to burn even after you think they are gone. The flame could potentially start a fire inside your garbage can or outside your house. You may reduce this danger by making sure to smoke outside, keeping an eye out for stray ashes, and putting the cigarette out thoroughly before putting it away.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="col-9">
			<h2 class="text-warning">Cut the Clutter</h2>
			<p>One way that flames can spread excessively and start spontaneously in your home is through clutter. You can lower your risk and increase the likelihood of saving your home from a fire by keeping your home less cluttered. Keep your home a little more organized and remove the extra clutter since too much junk might give the fire a lot of space to spread.</p>

		</div>

		<div class="col-9">
			<h2 class="text-warning">Turn Off Heated Appliances Before Leaving</h2>
			<p>Even your dishwasher uses a fair amount of heat, and so does your dryer. The same is true of heated blankets and space heaters. All these items should not be left on while you are away from home because they may easily catch fire and start a large fire you would not see.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="col-9">
			<h2 class="text-warning">Frequently Check Electrical Connections</h2>
			<p>Regularly inspecting your home's electrical system does not require you to dig into the walls to look at electrical cables, but you should be checking anything visible. Keep an eye on your home's wall outlets and pay notice to any that stop functioning suddenly. Check your electric accessories for frayed or damaged cords. You shouldn't plug these into your electrical system if you already know about an issue because they could also be warning indications.</p>

		</div>

		<div class="col-9">
			<h2 class="text-warning">Keep the Debris Down</h2>
			<p>It is also crucial to keep debris off your house's exterior. Stray ashes or sparks can readily start a fire in flammable materials like firewood, leaves, and other objects. Do not let those things go close to your house because they can quickly spread fire to other parts of your property, and before you know it, you are dealing with a major blaze. You do not want to go through that, and the danger can get reduced easily.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="col-9">
			<h2 class="text-warning">Keep Oils and Gases Away from Flames</h2>
			<p>If you keep cooking oil in your kitchen, keep it away from the stove and other objects that could catch fire if they spark. The same holds for any gas you may store in a garage for your automobile, lawnmower, or other equipment. The gas should not be near a flame or spark that might ignite. You can be better prepared and reduce your chance of issues by carefully containing these materials in authorized containers and keeping them away by a safe distance from anything that could react with them.</p>
